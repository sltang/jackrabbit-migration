<h2>Apache Jackrabbit Migration and Query Tool</h2>
We present a backup/migration tool for Apache Jackrabbit complementary to the existing ones (<a href="http://wiki.apache.org/jackrabbit/BackupAndMigration">http://wiki.apache.org/jackrabbit/BackupAndMigration</a>). It provides some 
customization features that make it easier to use. See <a href="http://github.com/sltang/jackrabbit-migration/wiki">wiki</a> for more information.
